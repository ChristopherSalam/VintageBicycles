APPEND THIS TO THE READMEThis is a simple website showing a project portfolio of some bicycle repair, using ember.js.
With time, I believe it can evolve to an open library or even a history and proof of ownership for theft and recovery.
I hope to be able to create a server for this information and allow users to upload information.

Currently working on linking the individual bicycles with team members and adding information from other users.
