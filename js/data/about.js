blurb: 'I started collecting bikes to make sure I always had one.',
story: 'After my first bike theft, I felt prompted to set myself and I proceeded to buy a fleet of bicycles, craiglisting all around rural Inland California. My fleet parked out front caused many of my neighbors to ask about their prices and availability. Reluctant initially, I got into it after a few tranasctions. Fast forward to present day, bicycle knowledge, purchasing and advice, and history are chief interests of mine, as well as occasional consignments.'
