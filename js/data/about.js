blurb: 'I started collecting bikes to make sure I always had one.',
story: 'When my brand new-to-me Raleigh Pursuit bicycle was stolen during finals week, a bicycle purchased to replace another stolen bicycle, I felt prompted to set myself against theft, and I proceeded to buy a fleet of bicycles, craiglisting all around rural Inland California. I loved the stories of purchasing and talking to buyers more than fixing and reselling. These bicycles, placed outside my house (a <a href="http://bagginsend.net/history.html"> dome </a> at the time), caused many of my neighbors to ask about their prices and availability. Reluctant initially, I saw that what once was backup for me was leading to a set of successful transactions, vintage bicycles moving on to new owners who would create stories of their own. Fast forward to present day, bicycle knowledge, purchasing and advice, and history are chief interests of mine, as well as occasional consignments.'
